Contains various "recipes" explaining different computation techniques for certain scientific compuing problems. They are in a mixture of C, Octave and Python. Educational.

# Circuit Sim
Contains common techniques to simulate some standard circuits along with tools implemented along the way. Mostly in C and a couple in Octave

# Matrix Computation
Elementary functions in Octave. Several of the Octave scripts are written with noweb, the included Makefile generates the latex and .m source.
